<p><strong>IPCV Master Thesis: ‚ÄúRecognition of Sports Gestures with 3D Deep CNNs: Explanation of Networks‚Äù</strong> 
Human Action Recognition is one of the key tasks in video understanding. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are often used to tackle this issue. Although they usually perform
impressively for such action classifcation tasks, their interpretability remains challenging. During the last decade, various analytical visualization techniques such as Vanilla gradient-based
Backpropagation or Grad-CAM help understanding features, from input space, that strongly
supports the fnal decision and further network optimization.
In this thesis, we propose a novel visual features understanding technique for 3DCNNs for
action recognition. Its objective is to fnd salient features that played a key role in decision
making of the network. Our proposed visualization technique takes the features from the last
Convolutional layer before the fully connected layers of a trained model and generates a binary
feature importance map per channel. To reduce the contribution of relatively low magnitude
features, the fnal importance map is generated as a weighted sum of all binary channel maps.
Finally, the resulting importance map is propagated to the original frame thus ‚Äúexplaining‚Äù the
regions in them that contribute to the fnal decision. The method is fast and does not require
gradient computation.
Our proposed technique is applied to the Twin Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network
(TSTCNN) we designed for Table Tennis Action recognition task that was trained on our dataset
TTStroke-21. Feature visualization is performed at the RGB and Optical Ô¨Çow branches of the
network. Obtained results are compared to other visualization techniques both in terms of human
understanding and similarity metrics between importance maps generated by diÔ¨Äerent methods:
Vanilla gradient‚Äìbased Backpropagation, Guided Backpropagation and Grad-CAM. The metrics
show that generated maps are similar to those obtained with known Grad-CAM method, e.g.
Pearson Correlation Coefcient between the maps generated of RGB data for Grad-Cam and our
method is 0.7 ¬± 0.05 and 0.72 ¬± 0.06 on Optical Flow data. Visualization methods have been
applied to RGB Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (RGBSTCNN) and Optical
Flow Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (OFTSTCNN) to observe whether models
with similar architecture trained on the same dataset learn similar kind of knowledge. Comparing
all the models, it is observed that Our algorithm is similar to Grad-CAM and Guided GradCAM analytically. Finally, proposed method was applied to existing popular CNN architecture
AlexNet [20] and VGG-16 [33] and satisfactory results are obtained. Computationally, the
proposed algorithm is twice faster. Hence, this simple computationally inexpensive visualization
technique is similar to Grad-CAM but does not require heavy gradient computation.</p>

<p><strong>Summer Internship Project:
‚ÄúGraph Neural Network (GNN) Inference on FPGAs‚Äù.</strong></p>

<p>Summary: Graph Neural Network possess prospect in track reconstruction for the Large Hadron Collider use-case due to high dimensional and sparse data. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have the potential to speedup inference of machine learning algorithms compared to GPUs as they support pipeline operation. In our research, we have used hls4ml, a machine learning inference package for FPGAs and we have evaluated different approaches: Pipeline, Dataflow and Dataflow with pipeline blocks architectures. Results show that Pipeline architecture is the fastest but it has disadvantages such as large loop unrolling and non-functioning reuse factor. Our solution of large loop unrolling takes more than 100 hours to complete synthesis of Hardware architecture from High Level Synthesis(HLS) C++ code. On the other hand, our implementation of the system in Dataflow architecture is too slow but it does not solve large synthesis time. So we proposed an improvised Dataflow architecture where some of the building blocks are in pipeline architecture. We have found prominent results from this architecture but we have not solved the large synthesis time problem.</p>
